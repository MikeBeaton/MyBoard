# MyBoardOpenCore

Uses `ioreg -l` to look up current board id (from SMBIOS).

Assuming this project is cloned as a peer of (i.e. at same dir level as) Acidanthera's [OpenCorePkg](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg), then it will also show you which OC .yaml config file (or files) contains that board id - i.e. basically, will also show you which machine it is.
